    <p>This exercise is about making list</p>
    <p>Here's what I like about lists:</p>
    <li>They're useful for displaying lists of stuff</li>
    <li>That's about it</li>
    <p>When you make a list, do it in this order:</p>

    <ol type="1">
    <li>Decide if it's an ordered list or not</li>
    <li>If it's not an ordered list, use the ul tag, otherwise the ol tag</li> 
    <ul> <li> Use li tags nested in the list for your list items </li></ul>
    
    <ol>
    <li>Curveball! You can nest list inside each other</li>
    </ol>
    
    <li>You've got this, I believe in you!</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Here's a couple ways you can express yourself</p>
    <li>If you want to sound normal, just </li>
    <li> <i>
    If you want to sound interesting, try the italics tag
    </i>
    </li>
    <li>
       <b>If you want to sound annoying, try the bold tag</b> 
    </li>
    
    <p>You did it! You should be proud of yourself</p>
